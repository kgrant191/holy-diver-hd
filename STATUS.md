# Current status

Updated: 2026-10-22 (America/New_York).

## Current approved version

**0.0.2**, approved by the user in chat on 2026-10-22 and adopted as the main baseline through PR #1 (`fix/title-screen-1-1`). It repairs the title prompt background, aligns both entrance rock shelves across their full native spans, and removes the nested ZIP from Actions artifacts. This is an approved development build; no release tag or GitHub Release is published.

The previous candidate's rightward shelf extensions were incorrect. Full traversals from the user's two save states establish upper HD X0–128 at Y192 and lower X0–160 at Y544. Continuous caps now cover the far-left standing position and stop before Randy falls. Do not use the earlier stationary-boot footprint as the platform boundary.

Current ledge verification: 920 frames per build, with 920 paired RAM/PPU/OAM samples and identical APU writes/common PCM. Both replays walk fully left, hold, and step slowly right through the fall. See evidence/ledge_boundaries/verification.json and comparison.png. The title PNGs and rules retain the exact bytes tested in the original fresh/reset title replay. Against previous approved 0.0.1, only three background PNGs and the pack README change; 67 files remain byte-identical.

## Previous approved baseline

Development version **0.0.1**, using the approved historical v15.1 artwork, accepted after the Randy arm repair (the user said "much better"). Initial GitHub import preserves all 70 runtime pack files exactly; README.txt only updates the development version and source location. Version 1.0.0 is reserved for the completed, tested game pack.

Completed: entrance/title sequence, entrance environment, known shared Randy poses and normal/Twin Fire palettes, screen-2 crypt environment/enemies, bracelet drop and matching pause icon, shared defeat-effect phases, stage/lives cards, post-death HUD, and rear forearm/hand repair.

## Latest verification

- Both Randy costumes, left/right, standing and airborne idle/horizontal casts. Sampled run/upward frames unchanged.
- Screen-2 combat and Randy death retain RAM/PPU/OAM, APU writes and recorded audio. Frozen death pose includes the repaired arm.
- 2,040 emulated frames and 1,558 paired state captures: evidence/arm_repair/verification.json and TEST_RESULTS.md.
- Earlier v15 tests covered fresh start/reset, normal/Twin Fire death, enemy combat and collected-bracelet pause/resume. Historical results remain in evidence/v15/.

## Next work

Move to the next screen when its savestate or route is available. Inspect native tiles, palettes, entities and geometry first. Apply shared player/weapon/effect art where identities match, then build newly observed environment/enemies.

## Known limits

- This is a partial HD overhaul, not a finished all-stage pack.
- All six stage names and life counts 0–9 are mapped; live card coverage is Stage 1 and counts 3/2.
- Native player tiles $33, $34, $35 and $3C were previously observed as unmapped leg fragments. Investigate if a live route uses them; do not guess from tile numbers.
- The earlier report of Randy fully reverting to original art during death was not independently reproduced. Shared defeat fallbacks exist, and current recorded death poses remain HD.
- Old scripts remain for provenance. build.py is the supported build entry point.
- Full historical capture runs/videos and original savestates remain in the prior source/handoff archives. The repository keeps compact evidence and exact rollback inputs.
